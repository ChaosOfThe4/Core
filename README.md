First attempts at dma chair using memprocfs python api to connect to fpga board from a second pc. Therefore there is no malicious (unless you write to memory) code on the pc running the game

This probably won't help anyone but I left it public just in case someone cares. I just wanted an easy way to transfer/edit files between my pcs
